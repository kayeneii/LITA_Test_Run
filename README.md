### Summary
The purpose of this study was to examine the concept and practice of humanitarian intervention in the 21st Century, through the lens of the Gaza Conflict, having analyzed the factors constituting ethical and legal dilemmas (ranging from bias in historical narratives of Israel/Palestinian rights to the Gaza Strip, geopolitical interests of states, and the influence of culture and religion) as relates to the applicability of interventions.
It was found that there are significant factors affecting 21st-century humanitarian interventions and that there is a significant relationship between these factors and the Gaza Conflict, which is why this study recommended various strategies that could be adopted in developing and implementing effective intervention practices in 21st-century humanitarian crises.Therefore, it was concluded based on findings that there are ethical dilemmas and legal complexities inherent in the practice of humanitarian interventions today.

### Conclusion
The research on humanitarian interventions in the 21st century, using the Gaza Conflict as a case study, reveals the intricate interplay of ethical dilemmas and legal complexities that define modern interventions. The study highlights how cultural, historical, geopolitical, and religious factors shape the global response to such crises. It underscores the need for interventions that balance the principles of sovereignty with the moral imperative to protect human rights. The findings suggest that without a nuanced understanding of these factors, interventions risk exacerbating conflicts rather than resolving them, calling for more effective and ethically grounded approaches in international relations.

### Recommendations
The following recommendations are offered from the findings of the study:
- There is an urgent need to strengthen international legal frameworks governing humanitarian interventions. This involves revising existing laws and treaties, such as the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) doctrine, to reflect the uniqueness of 21st-century humanitarian crises and provide clearer guidelines on when and how interventions should occur. These frameworks must be robust enough to support timely and effective interventions while maintaining respect for state sovereignty. This includes enhancing the authority and capacity of international courts, such as the International Criminal Court (ICC), to determine culpability and prosecute violations of international humanitarian law.
- Strengthening multilateral cooperation to enhance the legitimacy and effectiveness of interventions by pooling resources, expertise, and strategic insights from various stakeholders. For example, the United Nations, regional bodies like the African Union and the Arab League, and international NGOs. Task forces should be better equipped to respond quickly and effectively to crises, such as the Gaza Conflict, by coordinating efforts across different organizations and ensuring that interventions are well-aligned with the needs on the ground. Intervening agents must avoid undermining one another and ensure that aid reaches those most in need without unnecessary delays.
- Intervention strategies must include comprehensive conflict analysis to identify root causes and key stakeholders. There is a need to address historical grievances, economic deprivation, political marginalization, and social inequalities in volatile regions like Gaza. Diplomatic and political engagement with local communities and stakeholders is crucial to ensuring that solutions are contextually relevant and sustainable.Addressing the root causes of conflict must go beyond the alleviation of immediate suffering of the affected population.
