## Project Title: Humanitarian Intervention in the 21st Century: Ethical Dilemmas, Legal Complexities and Effective Responses
### Summary, Conclusion and Recommendations

### Summary
The purpose of this study was to examine the concept and practice of humanitarian intervention in the 21st Century, through the lens of the Gaza Conflict, having analyzed the factors constituting ethical and legal dilemmas (ranging from bias in historical narratives of Israel/Palestinian rights to the Gaza Strip, geopolitical interests of states, and the influence of culture and religion) as relates to the applicability of interventions.
It was found that there are significant factors affecting 21st-century humanitarian interventions and that there is a significant relationship between these factors and the Gaza Conflict, which is why this study recommended various strategies that could be adopted in developing and implementing effective intervention practices in 21st-century humanitarian crises.Therefore, it was concluded based on findings that there are ethical dilemmas and legal complexities inherent in the practice of humanitarian interventions today.

### Conclusion
The research on humanitarian interventions in the 21st century, using the Gaza Conflict as a case study, reveals the intricate interplay of ethical dilemmas and legal complexities that define modern interventions. The study highlights how cultural, historical, geopolitical, and religious factors shape the global response to such crises. It underscores the need for interventions that balance the principles of sovereignty with the moral imperative to protect human rights. The findings suggest that without a nuanced understanding of these factors, interventions risk exacerbating conflicts rather than resolving them, calling for more effective and ethically grounded approaches in international relations.

### Recommendations
The following recommendations are offered from the findings of the study
